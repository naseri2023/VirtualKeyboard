# VirtualKeyboard
a simple virtual keyboard implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The virtual keyboard allows users to input text by clicking on on-screen keys or using their physical keyboard. Key presses are animated to simulate real key interaction, and special keys like "Backspace" and "Enter" are also functional. The project showcases event handling for both mouse clicks and keyboard events, as well as dynamic text input and key animations.
